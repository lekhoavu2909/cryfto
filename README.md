# Starting the App

To start the application, follow these instructions:

1. **Navigate to the Client Directory:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Change directory (`cd`) to the client directory where the frontend code is located: cd client


2. **Install Dependencies:**
- Before running the application, ensure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can do this by running: npm install


3. **Start the Development Server:**
- Once all the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running: npm run dev


This command will start the frontend.
